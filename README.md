# Virtual Maritime RobotX Challenge (VMRC)

This is the entry point for teams participating in the current [RobotX Maritime Challenge](http://robotx.org/) or the upcoming VMRC in 2019.

Currently this project includes a basic set of Gazebo simulation elements and examples to support development of RobotX systems.  
This is an active development project so we are adding and improving things all the time.  The project contains a simulation foundation, including an environment similar 
to the RobotX venue and description of the WAM-V platform.  It is intended as a first step for teams that would then extend the tools for their specific development needs.

## Getting Started

The [VMRC Wiki](https://bitbucket.org/osrf/vmrc/wiki) provides documentation on how to setup the simulation.  
The instructions assume a basic familiarity with the ROS environment and Gazebo.  If these tools are new to you, we recommend starting with the excellent [ROS Tutorials](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials)
